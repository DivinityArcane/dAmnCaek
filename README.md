dAmnCaek
========

Random Python dAmn server that will probably never go anywhere. (But, on a side note, might actually get finished. You never know, really.)

The plans are [basically] to implement the standards and basics of the protocol so that multiple clients may connect at once and communicate. It should prove useful for diagnostic and debugging purposes (running in a LAN) or maybe even used for a small server amongst friends (over the internet.)
